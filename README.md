# circle fitting inside outer circle Matlab script
Arguably the best way to fit small circles inside an outer circle, using minimization.

This was a personal challange. Hope it helps enthusiasts.

The matlab verion used was the R2017b.

Turn "plot_flag" on/off to see the physics animation.

Turn "plot_flag" off to improve speed.

I accept feedback for improvements.

Thank you!
