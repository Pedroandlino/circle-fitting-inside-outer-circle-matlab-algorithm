# circle fitting inside outer circle Matlab script
Arguably the best way to fit small circles inside an outer circle, using minimization.

This was a personal challange. Hope it helps enthusiasts.

The Matlab verion used was the R2017b.

Turn "plot_flag" on/off to see the physics animation.

Turn "plot_flag" off to improve speed.

Turn "plot_flag_final_result" in order to only see the circles in their final positions.

I accept feedback for improvements.

# NOTE: in the code circles are interpreted as points (i.e. pts)


Thank you!
